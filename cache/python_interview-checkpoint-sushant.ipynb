    "A->1.Python can be used to develop prototypes, and quickly because it is so easy to work with and read.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2.Most automation, data mining, and big data platforms rely on Python. This is because it is the ideal language to work with      for general purpose tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3.Python allows for a more productive coding environment than massive languages like C# and Java. Experienced coders tend       to stay more organized and productive when working with Python, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4.Python is easy to read, even if you're not a skilled programmer. Anyone can begin working with the language, all it takes     is a bit of patience and a lot of practice. Plus, this makes it an ideal candidate for use among multi-programmer and large     development teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5.Python powers Django, a complete and open source web application framework. Frameworks - like Ruby on Rails - can be used     to simplify the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "   6.It has a massive support base thanks to the fact that it is open source and community developed. Millions of like-minded       developers work with the language on a daily basis and continue to improve core functionality. The latest version of Python     continues to receive enhancements and updates as time progresses. This is a great way to network with other developers.\n",

    " A->PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code. This document provides the coding conventions for writing code in Python. \n",
    "    Coding   conventions are about indentation, formatting, tabs, maximum line length, imports organization, line spacing etc. \n",
    "    We use PEP 8 to bring consistency in our code. With consistency it is easier for other developers to read the code\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5].What is Pickling in Python?\n",
    "A-> Python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be \n",
    "    pickled so that it can be saved on disk. What pickle does is that it “serializes” the object first before writing it to \n",
    "    file. Pickling is a way to convert a python object (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream. The idea is that this \n",
    "    character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6].How does memory management work in Python?\n",
    "A->Python has a grabage collector, so there is now need (and no way) to do manual memory management. There is no need for any \n",
    "    news anywhere, and the only reason to use del is to clear up the local namespace. If you want to do memory management (say,\n",
    "    if you wanted speed) you should probably not be using Python, or you should forget about memory management and find a \n",
    "    better way to get speed improvements, for example, using numpy or Cython.\n",
    "    If you know C or Cython, then you can do manual memory management using the C API\n",

    "    square brackets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Dictionary:\n",
    "   Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are used to handle large amount of data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - Where to use Dictionary?\n",
    "    When you are dealing with unique keys and you are mapping values to the keys, use Dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "  -When to use List?\n",
    "    If you have a collection of data that does not need random access, use List.\n",
    "    Where you have to deal with values which can be changed, use List.\n",

    "       Conclusion.\n",
    "13].What is a Namespace in Python?\n",
    "A->A namespace in python is a collection of names. So, a namespace is essentially a mapping of names to corresponding objects.    At any instant, different python namespaces can coexist completely isolated- the isolation ensures that there are no name      collisions. Simply speaking, two namespaces in python can have the same name without facing any problem. A namespace is        implemented as a Python dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "14].How will you concatenate multiple strings together in Python?\n",
    "A->In order to merge two strings into a single object, you may use the “+” operator. \n",
    "    When writing code, that would look like this:\n",

    "    str2=\"world\"\n",
    "    str1+str2\n",
    "    \n",
    "15].What is the use of Pass statement in Python?\n",
    "A->The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to       execute. The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "16].What is the use of Slicing in Python?\n",
    "A->Python slice() Note that slice function returns slice object. \n",
    "    We can pass this object as a set of indices with sequences such as string, list, tuple etc. \n",
    "    Python slice function allows us to create a stepwise sub-sequence easily without doing complete iteration on the existing        sequence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "17].What is the difference between Docstring in Python and Javadoc in Java?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18].How do you perform unit testing for Python code?\n",
    "A->Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are tested. \n",
    "    This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.\n",
    "    The unittest test framework is python’s xUnit style framework.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Method:\n",
    "        White Box Testing method is used for Unit testing.\n",
    "        \n",
    "19].What is the difference between an Iterator and Iterable in Python?\n",
    "A->Iterable is an object, which one can iterate over. It generates an Iterator when passed to iter() method. \n",
    "    Iterator is an object, which is used to iterate over an iterable object using __next__() method. Iterators have __next__()     method, which returns the next item of the object.\n",
    "    Note that every iterator is also an iterable, but not every iterable is an iterator. \n",
    "    For example, a list is iterable but a list is not an iterator\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "20].What is the use of Generator in Python?\n",
    "A->generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield      keyword rather than return. \n",
    "   If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.\n",
    "   \n",
    "21].What is the significance of functions that start and end with _ symbol in Python?\n",
    "A->Following are different places where _ is used in Python:\n",

    "        \n",
    "22].What is the difference between xrange and range in Python?\n",
    "A->The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and xrange returns an xrange object. \n",
    "    ... It means that xrange doesn't actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. \n",
    "    It creates the values as you need them with a special technique called yielding.\n",
    "    \n",
    "23].What is lambda expression in Python?\n",
    "A->Python allows you to create anonymous function i.e function having no names using a facility called lambda function.\n",

    "    The result of the expression is the value when the lambda is applied to an argument.\n",
    "    \n",
    "24].How will you copy an object in Python?\n",
    "A->In case of shallow copy, a reference of object is copied in other object. \n",
    "    It means that any changes made to a copy of object do reflect in the original object. \n",
    "    In python, this is implemented using “copy()” function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "25].What are the main benefits of using Python?\n",

    "\n",
    "26].What is a metaclass in Python?\n",
    "A->A metaclass is the class of a class. ...\n",
    "    A class is an instance of a metaclass. While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows),      the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "27].What is the use of frozenset in Python?\n",
    "A->Python frozenset() The frozenset() method returns an immutable frozenset object initialized with elements from the given        iterable. Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any        time, elements of frozen set remains the same after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "28].What is Python Flask?\n",
    "A->Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. ..\n",
    "    . Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself\n",
    "    \n",
    "29].What is None in Python?\n",
    "A->None is just a value that commonly is used to signify 'empty', or 'no value here'. \n",
    "    It is a signal object; it only has meaning because the Python documentation says it has that meaning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "30].What is the use of zip() function in Python?\n",
    "A->The purpose of zip() is to map the similar index of multiple containers so that they can be used just using as single          entity.\n",

    "    \n",
    "33].How can we create a dictionary with ordered set of keys in Python?\n",
    "A->An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted. The only difference between     dict() and OrderedDict() is that:\n",
    "    OrderedDict preserves the order in which the keys are inserted. A regular dict doesn’t track the insertion order, and           iterating it gives the values in an arbitrary order. By contrast, the order the items are inserted is remembered by             OrderedDict.\n",
    "    \n",
    "34].Python is an Object Oriented programming language or a functional programming language?\n",
    "A->both\n",

    "    Get resultSet from the cursor object using a cursor.fetchall().\n",
    "    \n",
    "36].What is the difference between append() and extend() functions of a list in Python?\n",
    "A->append adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list itself will increase by one.          extend iterates over its argument adding each element to the list, extending the list. The length of the list will increase    by however many elements were in the iterable argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "37].How will you handle an error condition in Python code?\n",
    "A->by exception handling.. try ..except and finally\n",
    "\n",
    "38]..What is the difference between split() and slicing in Python?\n",
    "A->Slicing the end of the string. You have to know how long your extension is, otherwise you can get it with a combination of       len and str.index.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Splitting the extension. If you have complicated filenames this might pose a problem, but often is a good approach.\n",
    "    \n",
    "39].How will you check in Python, if a class is subclass of another class?\n",
    "A-> Use issubclass(myclass, parentclass).\n",

    "   B. Within the Interpreter.\n",
    "   C. From Within Your Program.\n",
    "     \n",
    "41].How do you profile a Python script?\n",
    "A-Python includes a profiler called cProfile. It not only gives the total running time, but also times each function              separately, and tells you how many times each function was called, making it easy to determine where you should make            optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "42].What is the difference between ‘is’ and ‘==’ in Python?\n",
    "A->The == operator compares the values of both the operands and checks for value equality. Whereas is operator checks whether       both the operands refer to the same object or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "43].How will you share variables across modules in Python?\n",
    "A->This is an approach using the built-in python keyword - global. If the 2 screens are in the same file, use the global          variable so they can both access. That means, when you want to use the value, no matter for the first time or for later        using, you need to use the keyword global to let the compiler know that it’s not a local variable.\n",
    "    Disadvantage of this approach is quite obvious, that means if you use it too much, the global variables will be everywhere     in your codebase, and it’s hard to trace its value change or later refactoring.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "   Use a separate module to hold all the shared variables.\n",
    "    It’s simple, use a single module to hold all the variables you want to use. And next, whenever you want to use them, just       import this module, and use it. Don’t worry, it will always use the latest value no matter how you set it in the original        separate module.\n",
